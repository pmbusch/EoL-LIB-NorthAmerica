# Future battery recycling in North America: Capacity expansion under shifting demand and circularity strategies

Scripts to run the Material Flow Analysis (MFA) model.

All scripts are numbered in order suggested to run to replicate full results.

* **01-ModelParameters.R**: Define model parameters and settings.
* **02-EV_LIB_Demand_Recycling.R**: Estimates battery (LIB) requirements for EVs and recycling outflows. 
* **03-StationaryStorageStock.R**: Estimates battery (LIB) requirements for stationary storage.
* **04-RunScenarios.R**: **Master** script to run scenarios for the MFA model with different parameters.

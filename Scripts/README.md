# Future battery recycling in North America: Capacity expansion under shifting demand and circularity strategies

Folders:

* **Functions**: Define common user-built functions used throughout the model.
* **Prepare Data**: Scripts to load and process original data sources into model inputs.
* **Run Model**: Scripts to run the Material Flow Analysis (MFA) model.

Scripts:

All scripts are numbered in order suggested to run to replicate full results. Code is to replicate main figures for the article.

* **00-Libraries.R**: Load required R libraries.
* **Figure2.R**: Battery inflows and outflows for North America, by source type or country.  
* **Figure3-Trade.R**: Battery recycling feedstock by country for pre-processing and refining.
* **Figure4-Capacity.R**: Comparison of recycling capacity for pre-processing (whole batteries) and refining (black mass contained in cathode materials), with recycling feedstock.
* **Figure5-Heatmap.R**: Sensitivity analysis for recycling capacity deficit in 2035, defined as feedstock minus planned capacity.
